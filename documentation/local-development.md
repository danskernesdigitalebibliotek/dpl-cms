# Local development

## Copy database from Lagoon environment to local setup

Prerequisites:

* Login credentials to the Lagoon UI, or an existing database dump

The following describes how to first fetch a database-dump and then import the
dump into a running local environment. Be aware that this only gives you the
database, not any files from the site.

1. To retrieve a database-dump from a running site, consult the
   "[How do I download a database dump?](https://docs.lagoon.sh/lagoon/resources/tutorials-and-webinars#how-do-i-download-a-database-dump)"
   guide in the official Lagoon. Skip this step if you already have a
   database-dump.
2. Place the dump in the [database-dump](../database-dump) directory, be aware
   that the directory is only allowed to contain a single `.sql` file.
3. Start a local environment using `task dev:reset`
4. Import the database by running `task dev:restore:database`

## Copy files from Lagoon environment to local setup

Prerequisites:

* Login credentials to the Lagoon UI, or an existing nginx files dump

The following describes how to first fetch a files backup package
and then replace the files in a local environment.

If you need to get new backup files from the remote site:

<!-- markdownlint-disable ol-prefix -->
1. Login to the lagoon administration and navigate to the project/environment.
2. Select the backup tab:

![backup_tab image](images/backup_tab.png)

3. Retrieve the files backup you need:

![retrieve image](images/retrieve.png)
4. Due to a UI bug you need to RELOAD the window and then it should be possible
   to download the nginx package.
<!-- markdownlint-enable ol-prefix -->

Replace files locally:

1. Place the files dump in the [files-backup](../files-backup) directory, be aware
   that the directory is only allowed to contain a single `.tar.gz` file.
2. Start a local environment using `task dev:reset`
3. Restore the files≈° by running `task dev:restore:files`

## Get a specific release of dpl-react - without using composer install

In a development context it is not very handy only
to be able to get the latest version of the main branch of dpl-react.

So a command has been implemented that downloads the specific version
of the assets and overwrites the existing library.

You need to specify which branch you need to get the assets from.
The latest HEAD of the given branch is automatically build by Github actions
so you just need to specify the branch you want.

It is used like this:

```bash
BRANCH=[BRANCH_FROM_DPL_REACT_REPOSITORY] task dev:dpl-react:overwrite
```

Example:

```bash
BRANCH=feature/more-releases task dev:dpl-react:overwrite
```
