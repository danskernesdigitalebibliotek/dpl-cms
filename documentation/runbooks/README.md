# DPL CMS Runbooks

This directory contains our operational runbooks for standard procedures
or common tasks around the handling of the DPL CMS.


Most runbooks has the following layout.

* **Title** - Short title that follows the name of the markdown file for quick
  lookup.
* **When to use** - Outlines when this runbook should be used.
* **Prerequisites** - Any requirements that should be met before the procedure is
  followed.
* **Procedure** - Stepwise description of the procedure, sometimes these will
  be whole subheadings, sometimes just a single section with lists.

The runbooks should focus on the "How", and avoid explaining any.
