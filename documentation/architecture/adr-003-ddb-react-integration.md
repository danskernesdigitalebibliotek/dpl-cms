# Architecture Decision Record: DDB React integration

## Context

The DDB React components needs to be integrated and available for rendering in Drupal.
The components are depending on a library token and an access token being set in javascript.

## Decision

We decided to download the components with composer and integrate them as Drupal libraries.

As described in [adr-002-user-handling](architecture/adr-002-user-handling.md) we are setting an access token in the user session when a user has been through a succesful login at Adgangsplatformen.

We decided that the library token is fetched by a cron job on a regular basis and saved in a KeyValueExpirable store which automatically expires the token when it is outdated.

The library token and the access token are set in javascript on the endpoint: /ddb-react/user.js
By loading the script asynchronically when mounting the components i javascript we are able to complete the rendering.
