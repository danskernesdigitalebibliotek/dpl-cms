    # The following options are used:
    # --enable-browser-proxying: Allows Wiremock to intercept all traffic from
    # services  with HTTP(s)_PROXY pointing at it.
    # --local-response-templating lets WireMock transfer values from request
    # to mocked response
    # --enable-stub-cors is required to make a browser running React
    # components request resources.
    # --verbose makes it easier to see requests and whether they are matched
    # or not.
