# Webmaster libraries

Libraries on the "webmaster" plan has extended permissions compared to
regular libraries. They have access to most of the Drupal
administration pages, and can install custom modules.

See [Permissions and roles](./permissions-and-roles) for details on
Drupal setup.

In addition to the Drupal setup, the site should use the `webmaster`
plan when configured in [DPL
Platform](https://danskernesdigitalebibliotek.github.io/dpl-docs/DPL-Platform/),
this creates a `moduletest` environment for testing and implies a
slightly different deployment scheduling.
