# Bibliotekernes Nationale Formidling

Bibliotekernes Nationale Formidling (henceforth "BNF") is a national
team handling sharing of content for libraries. The `bnf_server` and
`bnf_client` modules support their work.

## Server module

The server module is enabled on the main BNF site, which acts as a hub
for content sharing. The BNF team uses this site to create and edit
content provided for the libraries.

## Client module

The client module is enabled on library sites and handles pushing and
fetching content to/from the BNF site.
