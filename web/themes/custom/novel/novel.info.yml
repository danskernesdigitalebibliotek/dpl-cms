# We want to add dpl_react as a module dependency
# but we get an error upon theme install.
# Apparently others are getting same error since there is
# an issue about it:
# https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/is-sues/3176625
# But no seemingly stable patch is created at this point.
# When a proper fix has been created we can uncomment the
# "dependencies" block.
