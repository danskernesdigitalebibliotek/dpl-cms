/**
 * Mangle URLs in the development docker setup.
 *
 * In the development setup, the URLs the developer uses to view the site
 * doesn't exist for the code running inside the containers and the hostnames
 * the containers can use to communicate doesn't exist outside. This makes it
 * rather difficult to configure the BNF modules with an URL that's both valid
 * for server to server communication, and can be used in the UI.
 *
 * Furthermore, getting the sites to communicate using HTTPS, with a validating
 * certificate, is involved, so our HTTPS requirement for URLs is another
 * challenge.
 *
 * This sidesteps the issue by replacing the "outside" URL with the "inside"
 * HTTP URL for server to server connections. Code that sends the URL to the
 * browser should just use the configured URL, while code that does cross site
 * requests should pass the URL through `MangleUrl::server()` first, and not
 * worry about HTTPS as that's handled for them.
