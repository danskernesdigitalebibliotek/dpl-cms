INTRODUCTION

The module is handling import and inclusion of React js components
from the [DDB React project][1].

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires the components being downloaded eg. via composer
in the [libraries folder](../../../libraries/dpl-react)

INSTALLATION
------------
Activate module the way you would do with a standard Drupal module.

TRANSLATION

Text strings in the React components are being translated and used as is
in the js components.
As it is now there is no concept of translating strings
in the DDB React project.
The strings are passed as data attributes as described [here][2].
