 * Provider for accessing the agency id for the current library organisation.
 *
 * The agency id is also referred to as the ISIL nummber or library number
 * (biblioteksnummer). Example: 710100 is the agency id for the Copenhagen City
 * Libraries.
 *
 * It is sometimes prefixed by a country code e.g. DK-710100 but this should
 * not be the case here.
 *
 * The provider is located within the DPL Login module because with the
 * integration with Adgangsplatformen most of such information should be
 * contained within libary and patron tokens. Some legacy systems might still
 * require this info. This class provides a single point of entry.
