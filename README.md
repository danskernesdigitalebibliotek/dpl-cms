# dpl-cms - The library CMS, powered by Drupal

This is the main repository used for building the core Drupal CMS which is used
by the danish public libraries.

This repo uses styling from the
[dpl-design-system repo](https://github.com/danskernesdigitalebibliotek/dpl-design-system/).

You can find the full documentation, along with setup instructions in either the
[documentation site](https://danskernesdigitalebibliotek.github.io/dpl-docs/DPL-CMS/),
or directly in [the docs folder](docs/)

**tl;dr:** Run `task dev:reset` to get the site up and running locally.
